# Watch what ran


## Run history

With `history` set in `jobs.yaml`, `run` records one entry per job after each cycle: a JSON line in a file, or a row in a table. Nothing reads it to decide what to run; it's for answering "what happened last night".

```yaml
history: ../transaction/history.jsonl    # a file, relative to jobs.yaml
history:
  connection: warehouse                  # or a table
```

```
bauta history
bauta history --job loadOrders --limit 5
bauta history --format json
```

```
FINISHED (UTC)       JOB                          STATUS           ROWS   SECONDS  ERROR
2026-09-16 02:00:14  loadInvoices                 skipped             0       0.0  predecessor(s) did not complete: loadCustomers
2026-09-16 02:00:13  loadCustomers                failed              0       1.0  OperationalError: timeout
2026-09-16 02:00:12  loadOrders                   completed        4200      12.5
```

`--history FILE` or `--history-connection ALIAS` overrides the setting, on `run` and on `history`.

Each record has `runId` (shared by the jobs of one cycle), `job`, `status`, `rowCount`, `attempts`, `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, `durationSeconds` and `error`, cut to 2000 characters. A file grows by one line per job per run, so rotate it with `logrotate` or similar.

**Alerting on staleness.** In a table, history answers the question worth alerting on, whether a job has stopped completing, from any dashboard or monitor that runs SQL. Alert on this rather than on one failure, which the next run's retry may already have fixed:

```sql
SELECT job, max(finished_at) AS last_success
FROM bauta_history
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY job
HAVING max(finished_at) < <now, in seconds since 1970> - 3 * 3600
```


## Notifications

`--notify-url URL`, or `$BAUTA_NOTIFY_URL`, posts JSON to a webhook when a cycle doesn't succeed: a job failed or was skipped, or a signal stopped the run. `--notify-on always` posts after every cycle.

```json
{
  "text": "bauta on etl-7d9f: failed -- 1 completed, 1 failed, 1 skipped, 4200 row(s)\n- loadCustomers failed: OperationalError: timeout\n- loadInvoices skipped: predecessor(s) did not complete: loadCustomers",
  "status": "failed",
  "host": "etl-7d9f",
  "summary": {"completed": 1, "failed": 1, "skipped": 1, "rows": 4200},
  "jobs": [{"job": "loadOrders", "status": "completed", "rowCount": 4200, "durationSeconds": 12.5, "error": null}, "..."]
}
```

Slack, Mattermost and Microsoft Teams incoming webhooks show `text` as it is; anything else can read the rest. The URL usually carries a token, so prefer the environment variable to the flag. Error messages come from the database drivers. Values they quote are replaced with `<redacted>` for every message format the tests know, but not every format a driver can write (see [the security model](../concepts/security.md#where-unmasked-data-goes)); keep that in mind when choosing the channel.

History and notifications never affect a run's outcome. If one fails, the failure is logged and the run carries on.
